# Cell Neuclei Detection using Semantic Segmentation with U-Net

## 1. Summary
- The aim of the project is to detect cell nuclei from biomedical images effectively.
-  s cell nuclei vary in shapes and sizes, semantic segmentation proves to be the best approach to detect them. 
-  A deep learning model is trained and deployed for this task. The model is trained with the well known [2018 Data Science Bowl dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018)
